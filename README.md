## About

A mobile app with the purpose of faciliating school activities and interaction between parents and administration.

The idea was conceptualized over the course of the [BlockchainsForSchools](https://blockchainsforschools.org/) Summer Immersion Program Hackathon at the [Bushwick Generator](https://www.thebushwickgenerator.com/) during July 2019.

Evolved out of using blockchain when development continued during Stuyvesant High School's Summer Innovation Program during August 2019.

Currently continuing development under the guidance of mentors from the Google Mentorship Program in collaboration with Stuyvesant High School.
